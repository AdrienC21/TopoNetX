    "In mathematics, a cell complex is a space that is constructed by attaching lower-dimensional cells to a topological space to form a new space. The cells are attatched to the space in a specific way, and the resulting space has a well-defined structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a cell complex can be used to represent a simplicial complex, which is a collection of points, line segments, triangles, and higher-dimensional simplices that are connected in a specific way. Each simplex in the simplicial complex is called a cell, and the cell complex consists of all of these cells *and* the way they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell complex is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of points (called vertices or 0-cells), a set of line segments (called edges or 1-cells), and a set of polygons (called faces or 2-cells), such that the vertices, edges, and faces are connected in a consistent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of a cell c âˆˆ X is denoted by d(c), and the dimension of a cell complex is the largest dimension of one of its cells. $[1]$"
