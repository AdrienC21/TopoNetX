TopoNetX
=========

The TNX library provides classes and methods for modeling the entities and relationships 
found in higher order networks such as simplicial, cellular, CW and combinatorial complexes. 
This library serves as a repository of the methods and algorithms we find most useful
as we explore what higher order networks can tell us.

TNX was developed by pyt-team.
